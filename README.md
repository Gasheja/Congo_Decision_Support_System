# Congo_Decision_Support_System
This project aims at creating a robust software platform that securely stores and manages essential and sensitive citizen data to enable data-driven decision-making and policy development. By harnessing the power of information, this project aims to support the socio-economic development of the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The ultimate goal is to address the region's unique challenges, including conflict, poverty, and underdevelopment, through informed governance and targeted interventions.
Eventhough there are other contributing factors to the ongoing conflict in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the lack of the sofware platform to store the data of the citizen is among them. So, to resolve this problem, I created this software product as part of my contribution towards this problem.
